# File Organizer Ultimate

File Organizer Ultimate is a simple yet powerful desktop application for Windows that helps you quickly clean up and organize messy folders. It analyzes the files in a directory, groups them by type (e.g., MP3, PNG, PDF), and lets you move them into neatly organized subfolders.

## Features

-   **Interactive Preview:** See exactly how your files will be organized before committing to any changes.
-   **Customizable Rules:** Don't like the default folder names? Double-click any rule to rename the destination folder to whatever you like (e.g., change `MP3 Files` to `My Music`).
-   **Simple Interface:** A clean and straightforward user interface built with CustomTkinter.
-   **Safe:** The app moves files only when you click "Apply Organization". It never deletes anything.
-   **Standalone:** No installation required! Just download the `.exe` file and run it.

## How to Use

1.  **Select Folder**: Click the **[Select Folder...]** button to choose the directory you wish to organize.

2.  **Analyze (Preview)**: Click **[Analyze Folder (Preview)]**. The application will scan the folder and show you a preview of the organization plan.
    -   The left panel shows all the files found in the folder.
    -   The right panel shows the "rules" that will be used. By default, it creates a folder for each file type.

3.  **Edit Rules (Optional)**: If you don't like a destination folder's name, just double-click it in the right-hand panel and type a new name.

4.  **Apply Organization**: Once you are satisfied with the plan, click **[Apply Organization]**. The app will move all files into their corresponding new folders.
